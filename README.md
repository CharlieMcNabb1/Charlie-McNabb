# Hey
I'm Charlie (He/him), a third-year computer science major at the Colorado School of Mines, focusing on AI and robotics. I'm also a designer and developer. I mainly work on personal projects and school work on my GitHub, so currently, all of my repositories are private due to my application AI and other personal data.
